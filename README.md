# dark-starve
darkest starving (in a dungeon)

This is a video game that is not at all related to any of the other various videogames you may have played 
that use lighting as a signature mechanic. 

The characters have to recover their identities in a disorienting world that shifts under your feet while fighting against their worst nightmares and inner demons not just in the schlocky literal sense (but yes, that too) in order to escape from this desolate prison world, or rot forever with all the other failures and exiles until all memories have faded. 

watch out for the skrack.
